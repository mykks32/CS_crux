# Table: Delivery

| Column Name                 | Type |
|------------------------------|------|
| delivery_id                  | int  |
| customer_id                  | int  |
| order_date                   | date |
| customer_pref_delivery_date  | date |

Delivery table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).

- If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, the order is called **immediate**.
- Otherwise, it is called **scheduled**.

The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

## Example 1

**Input: Delivery table**

| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date  | customer_pref_delivery_date |
|------------:|------------:|------------|----------------------------|
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                 |
| 2           | 2           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                 |
| 3           | 1           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-12                 |
| 4           | 3           | 2019-08-24 | 2019-08-24                 |
| 5           | 3           | 2019-08-21 | 2019-08-22                 |
| 6           | 2           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-13                 |
| 7           | 4           | 2019-08-09 | 2019-08-09                 |

**Output:**

| immediate_percentage |
|--------------------:|
| 50.00               |

**Explanation:**

- Customer 1 → first order: delivery_id 1 → scheduled
- Customer 2 → first order: delivery_id 2 → immediate
- Customer 3 → first order: delivery_id 5 → scheduled
- Customer 4 → first order: delivery_id 7 → immediate

Hence, half the customers have immediate first orders.
